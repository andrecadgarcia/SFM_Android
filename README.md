# Structure From Motion Android

Simple project to test SFM process in android phones
Using [BoofCV](https://github.com/lessthanoptimal/BoofCV) for Image processing
and [Rajawali](https://github.com/Rajawali/Rajawali) for 3D rendering

#### Menu

1. Camera: Takes picutes and store in folder named as current timestamp
2. Gallery: Shows pictures and objects folders
3. Calibration: Calibrates android camera using chessboard

#### SFM - Execution

Executes SFM by clicking in any folder in Gallery (.png folders)
The process may take a while and can be cancelled at anytime

#### 3D Viwer

Also in Gallery, change from .png to .obj by clicking in box. It will show current objects generated by sfm.
The viewer provides X,Y,Z slider controls for object visualization, also a rotation checkbox to start/stop rotation.
A selector allows the object type visualization (Sequential, Points and All to All).

#### Object Types

1. Sequential: Show object with points connected sequentially (e.g. (1,2,3) (2,3,4) (3,4,5))
2. Points: Show point cloud object
3. All to All: Show object with one point connected to all others (e.g. (1,2,3) (1,2,4) (1,3,2))

#### Build

Download project and open with Android Studio.
Sync project with Gradle.
Have Fun =D
